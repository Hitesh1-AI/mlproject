"This is my first Machine Learning project."

This is a Python package that provides a framework for implementing machine learning algorithms. It is built using the setuptools library, which allows for easy installation and distribution. This package provides a range of tools and features for working with machine learning models, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Some of the key features of this project include:

A modular architecture that allows for easy customization and extension.
A range of pre-built machine learning regression models.
Support for data types, like tabular and labelled data.
Tools for data preprocessing, including normalization, and imputation.
Built-in tools for evaluating models, like r2-score.
A user-friendly API for training, predicting, and evaluating models.
Support for popular machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, Pandas, os, sys, and Numpy.
